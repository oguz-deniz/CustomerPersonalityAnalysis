# Customer Personality Analysis with Clustering Approach

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of customer personality using clustering techniques. The project encompasses a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction and elimination, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), standardization, the implementation of nine different clustering approaches, hyperparameter tuning, and a thorough profiling analysis (I provided a more comprehensive project report for further investigation in IEEE format in the 'report' directory).

## Project Highlights

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between features.

* **Feature Extraction and Elimination:** Identify key features for clustering and eliminate irrelevant ones to improve model performance.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality using PCA to capture the most important variance in the data.

* **Clustering Approaches:** Implement nine distinct clustering algorithms to group customers based on their characteristics.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune clustering algorithms to optimize cluster quality.

* **Profiling Analysis:** Gain insights into each customer segment, uncover patterns, and make data-driven decisions for marketing and product strategies.
