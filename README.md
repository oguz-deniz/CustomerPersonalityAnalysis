# Customer Personality Analysis with Clustering Approach

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of customer personality using clustering techniques. The project encompasses a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction and elimination, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), standardization, the implementation of nine different clustering approaches, hyperparameter tuning, and a thorough profiling analysis (I provided a more comprehensive project report in IEEE format in the 'results' directory.).

## Project Highlights

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between features.

* **Feature Extraction and Elimination:** Identify key features for clustering and eliminate irrelevant ones to improve model performance.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality using PCA to capture the most important variance in the data.

* **Clustering Approaches:** Implement nine distinct clustering algorithms to group customers based on their characteristics.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune clustering algorithms to optimize cluster quality.

* **Profiling Analysis:** Gain insights into each customer segment, uncover patterns, and make data-driven decisions for marketing and product strategies.

## Repository Contents

* **Code:** Detailed Jupyter notebooks covering each project phase are available in the 'code' directory.

* **Data:** The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the 'data' directory.

* **Results:** Comprehensive results, visualizations, and insights are provided in the 'results' directory.
